    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Jordan, and I'm a navy veteran who's recently<br>
       found a new passion in software engineering. I currently work in missile<br>
       defense, where I get to apply my coding skills on Linux operating systems<br>
       every day. Before entering the tech industry, I've had a diverse range of<br>
       experiences in different fields, including maritime industry, carpentry, and<br>
       administration. However, I've found that the coding world is where I truly<br>
       belong and enjoy the most.
       <br>

      One of the things that excites me about software engineering is that it's<br>
      constantly evolving, and there's always something new to learn. I love to<br>
      challenge myself and push my boundaries to keep up with the latest<br>
      developments in the field. Whether it's working on a new project or learning<br>
      a new coding language, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and grow<br>
      as a developer.
      <br>
      
      Overall, I'm a dedicated and passionate software engineer who's committed<br>
      to delivering high-quality work and continuously improving my skills.<br>
      I'm excited to see where this journey will take me and to continue learning<br>
      and growing in the dynamic and ever-changing world of coding.</p>
